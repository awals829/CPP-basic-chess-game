# C++-basic-chess-game
Simple terminal chess game that I made to practice C++ classes, encapsulation, abstraction, and modularization.

I used Emacs to build the game files and a linux terminal to run the program.

Most documentation was removed for the time being aside from header information, I will aim to reapply in time.
