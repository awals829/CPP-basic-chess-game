# C++-basic-chess-game
Simple terminal chess game that I made to practice C++ classes, encapsulation, abstraction, and modularization.

I used Emacs to build the game files and a linux terminal to run the program.

Most documentation was removed for the time being aside from header information.

To run the program, download the files and enter 'make game' in the terminal in the directory the files are located. 

To remove all object and extra files from the directory - type 'make clean'.
